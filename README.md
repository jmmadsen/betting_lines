Creates a mailing list to send daily sports betting information.

I host this app on Heroku, so local environment variables are hidden. URL for my server is <a>https://agile-journey-20831.herokuapp.com/<a>. The Heroku ClearDB addon is used for my database.
  
If you would like to be added to the email list, let me know!
